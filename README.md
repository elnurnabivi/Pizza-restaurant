## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for our Pizza Ordering Website - a simple yet interactive landing page for pizza enthusiasts. This project serves as a showcase of a modern web application built using React and standard web technologies like HTML and CSS.

## Features

This Pizza Ordering Website is a React-based project that combines the simplicity of HTML and the styling power of CSS to provide a seamless user experience. The application uses React's component-driven architecture to manage and pass data efficiently, leveraging props for data flow between components. Dynamic content is intelligently rendered on the page using React's conditional rendering capabilities, often utilizing the ternary operator for clean and concise logic expressions. Throughout the application, JavaScript methods such as map() play a crucial role in manipulating data structures for the display of pizza lists and details, demonstrating a practical implementation of JavaScript within a React application.
